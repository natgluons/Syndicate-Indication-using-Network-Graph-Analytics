# Syndicate Indication using Network Graph Analytics  

This project was developed for **Hackathon Bank Indonesia 2024**, utilizing **network graph analytics** to detect fraudulent activities and syndicate behavior.  

## Overview  
Fraud detection requires identifying hidden connections between entities. This project applies **Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)** models to analyze transaction networks, detect anomalies, and uncover syndicate activities.  

## Features  
- Graph-based fraud detection using network analytics  
- HGT model implementation for analyzing complex relationships  
- Automated pattern recognition to identify suspicious entities  

## Files  
- **HGTmodel_Syndicate-Indication-using-Network-Graph-Analytics.py** – HGT model implementation  
- **RAFM Working Group Proposal (PDF)** – Proposal submitted for Hackathon Bank Indonesia 2024  

This project demonstrates the potential of **graph AI** in financial fraud detection.
