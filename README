# Syndicate Indication using Network Graph Analytics  

This project was developed for **Hackathon Bank Indonesia 2024**, utilizing **graph network analytics** to detect fraudulent activities and syndicate behavior.  

## ðŸš€ Overview  
Fraud detection often requires identifying hidden connections between entities. This project leverages **Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)** models to analyze transaction networks, detect anomalies, and uncover syndicate activities.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- **Graph-based fraud detection** using network analytics  
- **HGT model implementation** for analyzing complex relationships  
- **Automated pattern recognition** to identify suspicious entities  

## ðŸ“‚ Files  
- **HGTmodel_Syndicate-Indication-using-Network-Graph-Analytics.py** â†’ HGT model implementation  
- **RAFM Working Group Proposal (PDF)** â†’ Proposal submitted for Hackathon Bank Indonesia 2024  

This project showcases the potential of **graph AI** in financial fraud detection.
